# WebScraping
web scraping practice and data visualization

After listening to the Philosophize This! podcast(https://www.philosophizethis.org/), I learned about the transcripts online and decided to practice web scraping and data visualization.

This project visualizes the word frequencies from any combined(or single) number of podcast episodes. Clicking on any word reveals words used around it, giving a more qualitative
description of that word.

There is a private list of words deemed irrelevant(the, and, or, I, etc.) that have been removed from the data for more menaingful results.
